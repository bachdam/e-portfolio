# Reflection
My three projects are Eduject, Online-Todo List, and Messaging Web App. All of them are my personal projects that I worked on over my time here at St. Thomas University.  The first project I created was the Online To-do List; that was the first step I made to contribute to the common good. I used what I learned not only from the University of St. Thomas but also in my free time to build hands-on products with the goal of improving our life quality in the future. Besides, the Eduject project is still in progress. Also, the Messaging Web App is an App that I learned how to build from a YouTube video, and it is still under construction. 

Inspired by Udemy, one of the famous and popular online education websites, I would like to create an Eduject where everyone of different ages, genders, backgrounds, and areas in the world has an opportunity to access education whenever they want. This illustrates the universityâ€™s emphasis on the value of community and respect for diversity. 
Also, I believe my project will meet the significant targets of our University of St. Thomas about the common good, which is providing learning accessibility so that everyone has an equal opportunity to be educated and chase their career goal. Having a solid foundation of knowledge will definitely help us achieve several awards and achievements which fulfill us more and more. A more sustainable future would be improved. 

From a technical view, Eduject was built with Full-Stack development, including using React.js to build dynamic Front-end and Node.js for Back-end. All the data are securely stored in MongoDB. Additionally, I created the login and sign-up authentication to protect the privacy of every user by applying JWT (JSON Web Token). I took a Usability & User Experience Design course at the University of St. Thomas, and I applied the knowledge I learned about usability and aesthetic principles to create an engaging and accessible platform. Users can easily select their role as either an instructor or a student after sign-up. The website provides unlimited courses, including both free and paid options. Students can enroll in multiple courses and start studying immediately, while instructors have the flexibility to modify their courses instantly, with updates in real-time.
